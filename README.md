# OPEN GRILL

OpenGrill is a open sourced 3D CAD collection of kitchen units. 
Each unit has its own folder with a set of required parts and STEP file of the unit 
for cutting list reference. Each unit uses 8mm x 30mm dowels and 34mm cam lock dowels with 5mm screw. 
Cam lock nuts are 15mm diameter by 14mm deep. The ones in the step files are **ONLY** for reference.

This is an early stage project and I will aim to answer any questions that are asked and welcome additional changes from community.

If you have a Feature / Unit request just open a Issue and I will see what I can do.

## Outdoor Kitchens

If you intend to use this to build outdoor kitchen set then I would recommend using Medite Tricoya 
this has a 50 year guarantee for outdoor use. For hinges would recommend something like
Blums BCOR https://www.blum.com/su/en/products/news-specials/hinges-with-bcor-surface-protection/overview/

## Jigs

The jigs located in the Jigs folder are for cutting the required holes for the dowels, cam dowels, shelf holes and the draw slide holes.
